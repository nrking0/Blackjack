# Final Project Proposal

### Blackjack!!!
For my final project in CS126, I thought it would be fun to create a playable 
Blackjack game using [**Cinder**](https://libcinder.org/) to visualize the game. 

The game would set up a virtual deck of cards and have an automated dealer that would play.
The dealer would give the player their cards and then by using mouse input, the player would
by given the option to hit or stay. The dealer would automatically play out, based on a set of rules,
and then a winner would be determined for the hand.


#### Motivation

I have always enjoyed playing cards, so I would love to program a way to play a card game that I find interesting.


#### Class Structure

This project would consist of the following classes:

* Player
  * Dealer (*Extends Player*)
* Card
* Deck
* Game Class
* Visual App Class
